# ðŸ’¾ Chunk Reader 

Chunk Reader is a Rust crate designed to facilitate asynchronous asset loading across different platforms. It 
provides a unified interface to fetch assets either from the local file system or over HTTP in 
WebAssembly (WASM) environments. Additionally, it includes a debug module to simulate asset loading delays, 
aiding in testing and development.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Asynchronous Asset Loading**: Load assets without blocking the main thread, ensuring smooth application performance.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Seamlessly handle asset loading for both native applications and WASM targets.
- **Debugging Tools**: Introduce intentional delays in asset loading to test application responsiveness and error handling.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Add chunk-reader to your projectâ€™s Cargo.toml:

```toml
